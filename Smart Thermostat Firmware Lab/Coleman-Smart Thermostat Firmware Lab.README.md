\# Smart Thermostat Firmware Vulnerability Lab

\#\# 📌 Overview  
This lab simulates insecure firmware update mechanisms in smart thermostat devices, modeled after IoT products like the Lennox S40. It demonstrates how vulnerabilities such as \*\*unsigned firmware\*\*, \*\*cloud dependency\*\*, and \*\*lack of authentication\*\* can be exploited in a controlled environment using Docker, Flask, and curl.

\> Educational Purpose Only: This project was designed for cybersecurity learning and is intended for ethical, local use in a virtual lab.

\---

\#\# 🎯 Objectives  
\- Understand how firmware update systems work  
\- Simulate insecure behavior like unsigned updates and cloud reliance  
\- Analyze risks and real-world parallels (e.g., Mirai botnet, Facebook DNS outage)  
\- Learn how to mitigate these common IoT firmware flaws

\---

\#\# 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
\- \*\*Python\*\* – core scripting  
\- \*\*Flask\*\* – lightweight web framework used to simulate API endpoints  
\- \*\*Docker & Docker Compose\*\* – to containerize and run servers  
\- \*\*curl\*\* – to simulate firmware upload requests  
\- \*\*.bin files\*\* – to simulate firmware payloads

\> 💡 If you're new to Flask: Flask is a Python tool that helps build simple web applications like the ones used to upload firmware or mimic a cloud server.

\#\# 📁 File Structure and Roles

| File | Description |  
|------|-------------|  
| \`Dockerfile\` | Sets up a Python/Flask environment for the firmware server |  
| \`docker-compose.yml\` | Runs both the cloud and firmware servers simultaneously |  
| \`Cloud\_Server/\` | Simulates the thermostat’s cloud dependency and API communication |  
| \`Firmware\_Server/\` | Hosts the firmware upload endpoint and simulates device behavior |  
| \`example\_firmware.bin\` | Placeholder firmware used to simulate upload behavior |  
| \`firmware\_unsigned.bin\` | Demonstrates the risk of accepting unsigned firmware |  
| \`README.md\` | Project documentation |

\#\# 🧪 Demonstrations

\#\#\# 1\. Uploading Unsigned Firmware

\*\*Command:\*\*  
\`\`\`bash  
curl \-F "firmware=@example\_firmware.bin" http://localhost:8080/update  
Result:

json  
Copy  
Edit  
{"message":"Firmware example\_firmware.bin uploaded and installed"}  
Why It’s Insecure:

No digital signature check

The device blindly installs any firmware

2\. Simulating a Vulnerability (Unsigned File Accepted)  
Command:

bash  
Copy  
Edit  
cp example\_firmware.bin firmware\_unsigned.bin  
curl \-F "firmware=@firmware\_unsigned.bin" http://localhost:8080/update  
Result:

json  
Copy  
Edit  
{"warning":"Firmware is unsigned but accepted (vulnerable behavior)"}  
Real-World Relevance:

Mirrors attacks like Mirai (2016), which compromised insecure IoT firmware

Highlights the danger of skipping integrity verification

3\. Cloud Server Dependency  
Command:

bash  
Copy  
Edit  
docker stop cloud-server  
Result:

json  
Copy  
Edit  
{"error":"Cloud service unreachable"}  
Risk:

The device cannot update firmware locally without cloud access

Introduces a Single Point of Failure (SPoF)

Mirrors outages like Facebook’s DNS/BGP issue in 2021

✅ How to Run the Lab  
Clone the project:

bash  
Copy  
Edit  
git clone https://github.com/Chontele-C/smart-thermostat-firmware-lab.git  
cd smart-thermostat-firmware-lab  
Start both servers:

bash  
Copy  
Edit  
docker compose up \--build  
Upload firmware using curl:

bash  
Copy  
Edit  
curl \-F "firmware=@example\_firmware.bin" http://localhost:8080/update  
Stop cloud service to simulate outage:

bash  
Copy  
Edit  
docker stop cloud-server  
🔐 Lessons & Mitigations  
Risk	Recommended Defense  
Unsigned firmware	Require digital signatures and verify using public key  
Insecure transport	Use HTTPS instead of HTTP  
Cloud-only logic	Add fallback logic for local updates  
No authentication	Validate uploader identity  
No logging	Record and flag suspicious or failed updates
