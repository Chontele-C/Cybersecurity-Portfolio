\# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio Lab

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity lab\! This repository showcases a collection of hands-on projects that demonstrate my skills in vulnerability simulation, attack monitoring, system hardening, penetration testing, and privilege escalation. Each project folder contains its own documentation and technical summaries.

\#\# 📁 Project Overview

\#\#\# 🔧 \[Smart Thermostat Firmware Vulnerability Lab\](./smart-thermostat-fw-vuln-lab)  
Simulates an unsigned firmware update vulnerability in a smart thermostat environment. Demonstrates how attackers could exploit weak update mechanisms and how these flaws can be safely tested in a lab.

\#\#\# 📊 \[Real-World Attack Monitoring with Splunk\](./splunk-threat-monitoring)  
Monitored simulated attacks using Splunk SIEM. Collected and analyzed log data to detect anomalies, generate alerts, and understand attacker behavior through dashboards and queries.

\#\#\# 🕵️ \[Simulated Penetration Test Report\](./pentest-report-simulation)  
Developed a structured pentest report following a simulated system assessment. Includes defined scope, methodology, discovered vulnerabilities, and actionable remediation recommendations.

\#\#\# 🛠️ \[Linux Hardening with Technical Brief\](./linux-hardening-brief)  
Performed a hardening process on a Linux system, disabling unnecessary services and enforcing security configurations. Includes a concise technical brief explaining the steps and their impact.

\#\#\# 🪟 \[Windows Privilege Escalation: AlwaysInstallElevated\](./always-install-elevated-win10)  
Exploited the AlwaysInstallElevated setting on Windows 10 to gain elevated privileges. Demonstrates a well-known local escalation method and includes walkthrough steps and mitigation advice.
